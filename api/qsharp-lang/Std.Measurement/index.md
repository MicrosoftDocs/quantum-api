# Std.Measurement

The Std.Measurement namespace contains the following functions and operations:


| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [MeasureAllZ](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MeasureAllZ) | Jointly measures a register of qubits in the Pauli Z basis.  |
| [MeasureEachZ](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MeasureEachZ) | Measures each qubit in a given array in the standard basis.  |
| [MeasureInteger](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MeasureInteger) | Measures the content of a quantum register and converts it to an integer. The measurement is performed with respect to the standard computational basis, i.e., the eigenbasis of `PauliZ`.  |
| [MResetEachZ](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MResetEachZ) | Measures each qubit in a given array in the Z basis and resets them to a fixed initial state.  |
| [MResetX](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MResetX) | Measures a single qubit in the X basis, and resets it to a fixed initial state following the measurement.  |
| [MResetY](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MResetY) | Measures a single qubit in the Y basis, and resets it to a fixed initial state following the measurement.  |
| [MResetZ](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MResetZ) | Measures a single qubit in the Z basis, and resets it to a fixed initial state following the measurement.  |
