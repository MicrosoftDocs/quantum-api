# Std.Measurement

The Std.Measurement namespace contains the following items:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [MResetEachZ](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MResetEachZ) | Measures each qubit in a given array in the Pauli Z basis and resets them to \|0⟩ state. |
| [MResetX](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MResetX) | Performs a single-qubit measurement in the Pauli X basis, and resets `target` to the \|0⟩ state after the measurement. |
| [MResetY](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MResetY) | Performs a single-qubit measurement in the Pauli Y basis, and resets `target` to the \|0⟩ state after the measurement. |
| [MResetZ](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MResetZ) | Performs a single-qubit measurement in the Pauli Z basis, and resets `target` to the \|0⟩ state after the measurement. |
| [MeasureAllZ](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MeasureAllZ) | Jointly measures a register of qubits in the Pauli Z basis. |
| [MeasureEachZ](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MeasureEachZ) | Measures each qubit in a given array in the Pauli Z basis. |
| [MeasureInteger](xref:Qdk.Std.Measurement.MeasureInteger) | Measures the content of a quantum register and converts it to an integer. The measurement is performed with respect to the standard computational basis, i.e., the eigenbasis of `PauliZ`. Input register is reset to the \|00...0⟩ state, which is suitable for releasing the register back to a target machine. |
