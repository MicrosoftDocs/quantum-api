# MeasureInteger operation

Fully qualified name: Std.Measurement.MeasureInteger

```qsharp
operation MeasureInteger(target : Qubit[]) : Int
```

## Summary
Measures the content of a quantum register and converts it to an integer.
The measurement is performed with respect to the standard computational basis,
i.e., the eigenbasis of `PauliZ`. Input register is reset to the |00...0⟩ state,
which is suitable for releasing the register back to a target machine.

## Input
### target
A quantum register in the little-endian encoding.

## Output
An unsigned integer that contains the measured value of `target`.
