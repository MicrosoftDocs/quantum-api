# MeasureAllZ operation

Fully qualified name: Std.Measurement.MeasureAllZ

```qsharp
operation MeasureAllZ(register : Qubit[]) : Result
```

## Summary
Jointly measures a register of qubits in the Pauli Z basis.

## Description
Measures a register of qubits in the `Z ⊗ Z ⊗ ••• ⊗ Z`
basis, representing the parity of the entire register.
This operation does not reset the measured qubits to the |0⟩ state,
leaving them in the state that corresponds to the measurement result.

## Input
### register
The register to be jointly measured.

## Output
The result of measuring in the `Z ⊗ Z ⊗ ••• ⊗ Z` basis.
