# DrawRandomBool operation

Fully qualified name: Std.Random.DrawRandomBool

```qsharp
operation DrawRandomBool(successProbability : Double) : Bool
```

## Summary
Given a success probability, returns a single Bernoulli trial
that is true with the given probability.

## Input
### successProbability
The probability with which true should be returned.

## Output
`true` with probability `successProbability`
and `false` with probability `1.0 - successProbability`.

## Example
The following Q# snippet samples flips from a biased coin:
```qsharp
let flips = DrawMany(DrawRandomBool, 10, 0.6);
```
