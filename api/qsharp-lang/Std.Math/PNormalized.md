# PNormalized function

Fully qualified name: Std.Math.PNormalized

```qsharp
function PNormalized(p : Double, array : Double[]) : Double[]
```

## Summary
Normalizes a vector of `Double`s in the `L(p)` norm.

That is, given an array x of type `Double[]`, this returns an array where
all elements are divided by the p-norm |x̄|ₚ.
Function leaves array with norm 0 unchanged.

## Input
### p
The exponent p in the p-norm.

## Output
The array x normalized by the p-norm |x̄|ₚ.
