# Complex user defined type

Fully qualified name: Std.Math.Complex

```qsharp
struct Complex { Real : Double, Imag : Double }
```

## Summary
Represents a complex number by its real and imaginary components.
The first element of the tuple is the real component,
the second one - the imaginary component.

## Example
The following snippet defines the imaginary unit 𝑖 = 0 + 1𝑖:
```qsharp
let imagUnit = Complex(0.0, 1.0);
```
