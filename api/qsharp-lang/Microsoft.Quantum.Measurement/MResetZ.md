# MResetZ operation

Namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement

```qsharp
operation MResetZ(target : Qubit) : Result
```

## Summary
Measures a single qubit in the Z basis,
and resets it to a fixed initial state
following the measurement.

## Description
Performs a single-qubit measurement in the Z-basis,
and ensures that the qubit is returned to |0‚ü©
following the measurement.

## Input
### target
A single qubit to be measured.

## Output
The result of measuring `target` in the Pauli Z basis.
