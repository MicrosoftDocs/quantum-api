# R1 operation

Fully qualified name: Std.Intrinsic.R1

```qsharp
operation R1(theta : Double, qubit : Qubit) : Unit is Adj + Ctl
```

## Summary
Applies a rotation about the |1⟩ state by a given angle.

## Input
### theta
Angle about which the qubit is to be rotated.
### qubit
Qubit to which the gate should be applied.

## Remarks
$$
\begin{align}
    R_1(\theta) \mathrel{:=}
    \operatorname{diag}(1, e^{i\theta}).
\end{align}
$$

Equivalent to:
```qsharp
R(PauliZ, theta, qubit);
R(PauliI, -theta, qubit);
```
