```

## Summary
Instructs the resource estimator to assume that the resources from the
call of this operation until a call to `EndRepeatEstimates` are
accounted for `count` times, without the need to execute the code that many
times. Calls to `BeginRepeatEstimates` and `EndRepeatEstimates` can be nested.

`within` block.

## Input
### count
Assumed number of repetitions, factor to multiply the cost with
