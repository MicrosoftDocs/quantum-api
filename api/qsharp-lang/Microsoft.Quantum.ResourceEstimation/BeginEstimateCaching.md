# BeginEstimateCaching function

Namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.ResourceEstimation

```qsharp
function BeginEstimateCaching(name : String, variant : Int) : Bool
```

## Summary
Informs the resource estimator of the start of the code fragment
for which estimates caching can be done. This function
is only available when using resource estimator execution target.

## Input
### name
The name of the code fragment. Used to distinguish it from other code fragments.
Typically this is the name of the operation for which estimates can be cached.
### variant
Specific variant of the execution. Cached estimates can only be reused if the
variant for which they were collected and the current variant is the same.

## Output
`true` indicated that the cached estimates are not yet available and the code fragment
needs to be executed in order to collect and cache estimates.
`false` indicates if cached estimates have been incorporated into the overall costs
and the code fragment should be skipped.
