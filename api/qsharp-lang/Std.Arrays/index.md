# Std.Arrays

The Std.Arrays namespace contains the following functions and operations:


| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [All](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.All) | Given an array and a predicate that is defined for the elements of the array, and checks if all elements of the array satisfy the predicate.  |
| [Any](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Any) | Given an array and a predicate that is defined for the elements of the array, checks if at least one element of the array satisfies the predicate.  |
| [Chunks](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Chunks) | Splits an array into multiple parts of equal length.  |
| [CircularlyShifted](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.CircularlyShifted) | Shift an array circularly left or right by a specific step size.  |
| [ColumnAt](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.ColumnAt) | Extracts a column from a matrix.  |
| [Count](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Count) | Given an array and a predicate that is defined for the elements of the array, returns the number of elements an array that consists of those elements that satisfy the predicate.  |
| [Diagonal](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Diagonal) | Returns an array of diagonal elements of a 2-dimensional array  |
| [DrawMany](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.DrawMany) | Repeats an operation for a given number of samples, collecting its outputs in an array.  |
| [Enumerated](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Enumerated) | Given an array, returns a new array containing elements of the original array along with the indices of each element.  |
| [Excluding](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Excluding) | Returns an array containing the elements of another array, excluding elements at a given list of indices.  |
| [Filtered](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Filtered) | Given an array and a predicate that is defined for the elements of the array, returns an array that consists of those elements that satisfy the predicate.  |
| [FlatMapped](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.FlatMapped) | Given an array and a function that maps an array element to some output array, returns the concatenated output arrays for each array element.  |
| [Flattened](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Flattened) | Given an array of arrays, returns the concatenation of all arrays.  |
| [Fold](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Fold) | Iterates a function `f` through an array `array`, returning `f(...f(f(initialState, array[0]), array[1]), ...)`.  |
| [ForEach](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.ForEach) | Given an array and an operation that is defined for the elements of the array, returns a new array that consists of the images of the original array under the operation.  |
| [Head](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Head) | Returns the first element of the array.  |
| [HeadAndRest](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.HeadAndRest) | Returns a tuple of first and all remaining elements of the array.  |
| [IndexOf](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.IndexOf) | Returns the first index of the first element in an array that satisfies a given predicate. If no such element exists, returns -1.  |
| [IndexRange](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.IndexRange) | Given an array, returns a range over the indices of that array, suitable for use in a for loop.  |
| [Interleaved](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Interleaved) | Interleaves two arrays of (almost) same size.  |
| [IsEmpty](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.IsEmpty) | Returns true if and only if an array is empty.  |
| [IsRectangularArray](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.IsRectangularArray) | Returns whether a 2-dimensional array has a rectangular shape  |
| [IsSorted](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.IsSorted) | Given an array, returns whether that array is sorted as defined by a given comparison function.  |
| [IsSquareArray](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.IsSquareArray) | Returns whether a 2-dimensional array has a square shape  |
| [Mapped](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Mapped) | Given an array and a function that is defined for the elements of the array, returns a new array that consists of the images of the original array under the function.  |
| [MappedByIndex](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.MappedByIndex) | Given an array and a function that is defined for the indexed elements of the array, returns a new array that consists of the images of the original array under the function.  |
| [MappedOverRange](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.MappedOverRange) | Given a range and a function that takes an integer as input, returns a new array that consists of the images of the range values under the function.  |
| [Most](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Most) | Creates an array that is equal to an input array except that the last array element is dropped.  |
| [MostAndTail](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.MostAndTail) | Returns a tuple of all but one and the last element of the array.  |
| [Padded](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Padded) | Returns an array padded at with specified values up to a specified length.  |
| [Partitioned](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Partitioned) | Splits an array into multiple parts.  |
| [Rest](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Rest) | Creates an array that is equal to an input array except that the first array element is dropped.  |
| [Reversed](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Reversed) | Create an array that contains the same elements as an input array but in reversed order.  |
| [SequenceI](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.SequenceI) | Get an array of integers in a given interval.  |
| [SequenceL](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.SequenceL) | Get an array of integers in a given interval.  |
| [Sorted](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Sorted) | Given an array, returns the elements of that array sorted by a given comparison function.  |
| [Subarray](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Subarray) | Takes an array and a list of locations and produces a new array formed from the elements of the original array that match the given locations.  |
| [Swapped](xref:Qdk.Std.Arrays.Swapped) | Applies a swap of two elements in an array.  |
