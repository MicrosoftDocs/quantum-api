# LookAheadDKRSAddLE operation

Fully qualified name: Microsoft.Quantum.Unstable.Arithmetic.LookAheadDKRSAddLE

```qsharp
operation LookAheadDKRSAddLE(xs : Qubit[], ys : Qubit[], zs : Qubit[]) : Unit is Adj
```

## Summary
Sets a zero-initialized little-endian register zs to the sum of
little-endian registers xs and ys using the carry-lookahead algorithm.

## Description
Computes zs := xs + ys + zs[0] modulo 2ⁿ, where xs, ys, and zs are
little-endian registers, Length(xs) = Length(ys) ≤ Length(zs) = n,
assuming zs is 0-initialized, except for maybe zs[0], which can be
in |0> or |1> state and can be used as carry-in.
NOTE: `zs[Length(xs)]` can be used as carry-out, if `zs` is longer than `xs`.
This operation uses the carry-lookahead algorithm.
