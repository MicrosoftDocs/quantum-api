# RippleCarryCGIncByLE operation

Namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Unstable.Arithmetic

```qsharp
operation RippleCarryCGIncByLE(xs : Qubit[], ys : Qubit[]) : Unit is Adj + Ctl
```

## Summary
Increments a little-endian register ys by a little-endian register xs
using the ripple-carry algorithm.

## Description
Computes ys += xs modulo 2ⁿ, where xs and ys are little-endian registers,
and Length(xs) ≤ Length(ys) = n.
Note that if Length(xs) != Length(ys), xs is padded with 0-initialized
qubits to match ys's length.
This operation uses the ripple-carry algorithm.
