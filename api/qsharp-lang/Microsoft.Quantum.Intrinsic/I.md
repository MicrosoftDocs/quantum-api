# I operation

Namespace: Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic

```qsharp
operation I(target : Qubit) : Unit is Adj + Ctl
```

## Summary
Performs the identity operation (no-op) on a single qubit.

## Remarks
This is a no-op. It is provided for completeness and because
sometimes it is useful to call the identity in an algorithm or to pass it as a parameter.
