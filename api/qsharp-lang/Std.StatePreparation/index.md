# Std.StatePreparation

The Std.StatePreparation namespace contains the following items:

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [ApproximatelyPreparePureStateCP](xref:Qdk.Std.StatePreparation.ApproximatelyPreparePureStateCP) | Given a set of coefficients and a big-endian quantum register, prepares a state on that register described by the given coefficients, up to a given approximation tolerance. |
| [PreparePureStateD](xref:Qdk.Std.StatePreparation.PreparePureStateD) | Given a set of coefficients and a big-endian quantum register, prepares a state on that register described by the given coefficients. |
| [PrepareUniformSuperposition](xref:Qdk.Std.StatePreparation.PrepareUniformSuperposition) | Prepares a uniform superposition of states that represent integers 0 through `nStates - 1` in a little-endian `qubits` register. |
