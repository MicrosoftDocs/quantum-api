# RippleCarryTTKIncByLE operation

Fully qualified name: Std.Arithmetic.RippleCarryTTKIncByLE

```qsharp
operation RippleCarryTTKIncByLE(xs : Qubit[], ys : Qubit[]) : Unit is Adj + Ctl
```

## Summary
Reversible, in-place ripple-carry addition of two integers.

## Description
Computes ys += xs modulo 2ⁿ, where xs and ys are little-endian registers,
and Length(xs) ≤ Length(ys) = n.
This operation uses the ripple-carry algorithm.
Note that if Length(ys) >= Length(xs)+2, xs is padded with 0-initialized
qubits to match ys's length. The operation doesn't use any auxiliary
qubits otherwise.
