## Operations

| Name | Summary |
|------|---------|
|[CNOT](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.CNOT) |In OpenQASM: `gate cx c,t { CX c,t; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[CZ](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.CZ) |In OpenQASM: `gate cz c,t { CZ c,t; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[H](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.H) |In OpenQASM: `gate h a { u2(0,pi) a; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[I](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.I) |
|[M](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.M) |
|[Reset](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.Reset) |
|[Rx](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.Rx) |In OpenQASM: `gate rx(theta) a { u3(theta,-pi/2,pi/2) a; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[Ry](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.Ry) |In OpenQASM: `gate ry(theta) a { u3(theta,0,0) a; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[Rz](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.Rz) |In OpenQASM: `gate rz(phi) a { u1(phi) a; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[S](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.S) |In OpenQASM: `gate h a { u2(0,pi) a; }`, `gate sdg a { u1(-pi/2) a; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[SWAP](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.SWAP) |Some QASM extensions have native swap support. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported since arbitrary numbers of control qubits.
|[T](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.T) |In OpenQASM: `gate t a { u1(pi/4) a; }`, `gate tdg a { u1(-pi/4) a; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[X](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.X) |In OpenQASM: `gate x a { u3(pi,pi/2,pi/2) a; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[Y](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.Y) |In OpenQASM: `gate y a { u3(pi,pi/2,pi/2) a; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
|[Z](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.OpenQASM.Intrinsic.Z) |In OpenQASM: `gate z a { u3(pi,pi/2,pi/2) a; }`. Note that the controlled specialization is not supported, since OpenQASM does not support artibrary numbers of control qubits.
