## Operations

| Name | Summary |
|------|---------|
|[Exp](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.Exp) |IonQ supports exp(i theta XX), exp(i theta YY), exp(i theta ZZ) with any number of controls out of the box. TODO: Make sure that angle and factor of two are consistent by using IonQ simulator.
|[H](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.H) |IonQ supports gate with any number of controls out of the box. H is equal to its inverse.
|[M](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.M) |All qubits are measured in the end of running IonQ program. This is equivalent to not beeing able to use a qubit after it was measured. For IonQ qubits is marked as measured and not used anymore after M was called.
|[Rx](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.Rx) |IonQ supports Rx gate with any number of controls out of the box. TODO: Make sure that angle and factor of two are consistent by using IonQ simulator.
|[Ry](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.Ry) |IonQ supports Ry gate with any number of controls out of the box. TODO: Make sure that angle and factor of two are consistent by using IonQ simulator.
|[Rz](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.Rz) |IonQ supports Rz gate with any number of controls out of the box. TODO: Make sure that angle and factor of two are consistent by using IonQ simulator.
|[S](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.S) |IonQ supports S gate with any number of controls out of the box. and its inverse.
|[SWAP](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.SWAP) |IonQ supports SWAP gate with any number of controls out of the box. SWAP is equal to its inverse.
|[T](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.T) |IonQ supports T gate with any number of controls out of the box. and its inverse.
|[X](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.X) |IonQ supports gate with any number of controls out of the box. X is equal to its inverse.
|[Y](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.Y) |IonQ supports gate with any number of controls out of the box. Y is equal to its inverse.
|[Z](xref:Microsoft.Quantum.Runtime.Decompositions.IonQ.Intrinsic.Z) |IonQ supports gate with any number of controls out of the box. Z is equal to its inverse.
